# React Weather App

### How it started

<p>
Initially Project was just a weather webpage with fast glance at weather in any city. With time I decided to create a fully-functional app, where user can save your cities personalize your start display city, search for random it, see 7 days and 24 hours forecast.

Morefather I turned that into the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-progressive-web-apps/">PWA</a> application. So no matter you're on the desktop or phone, you can use that app, it's responsive.

## Features

It's modern weather app created in react. You're able to search cities, add city to your collection, set specified city as a default display start, see forecast for 7 days and 24 hours and even check the weather in random city in the world.

## Design

Application was build with a though about pretty modern design that is merged with classic modern page design and glassy ui. I included some background images which context changes dependently on season. For save some performance i compressed images saving pretty good resolution too.
